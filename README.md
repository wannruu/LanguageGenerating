# Language Generating
Language Generating using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN).  
The TCN model predicts log-likelihood distribution of a string.  
The sample_random function can be used to randomly sample a sentence based on the model distribution.  
The beam_search function can be used to find the highest likelihood generations of strings.
